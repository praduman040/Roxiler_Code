# MERN Stack Coding Challenge - V2

## Description
This project is a solution to the MERN Stack Coding Challenge. The goal is to build a web application that leverages the full MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). The application adheres to the requirements specified in the challenge document.

## Features
- [Feature 1]: Brief description (e.g., User authentication using JWT).
- [Feature 2]: Brief description (e.g., CRUD operations for managing resources).
- [Feature 3]: Brief description (e.g., Responsive frontend with React).

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Redux (if applicable)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Additional Tools:** [Any tools you used, e.g., Mongoose, Axios, etc.]

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd [project-directory]
    ```

3. Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install

    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
    JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
    ```

5. Start the development servers:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev

    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage
